# CalCalSheet
Repository for the CalCalSheet scripts. The sheets are not part of the repository just a script files used in the sheet. 
You can find a copy link for the sheet at the [getting started](#how-can-i-get-it) section. 

## What is the Calorie Calculator Sheet? 
It’s a free application to calculate your calories, macros and many more. It’s based on a Google sheet, but don’t worry you don’t need excel knowledge to use it. It’s made to be used like any other application. 

## Do I need something to use it?  
You only need a Google account, a few megabyte free space on your google drive and a PC or Mobile.

## Why would I use this instead of a Calorie calculator mobile app (MyFitnessPal, Macrofactor, Noom etc.)?
It’s free, even the function that you usually need to pay for. Also it has features that none of the other calculators have. 

## There is a new calorie calculator start up application for free and with no ads. So why would I use this sheet instead?
Running servers cost a lot of money. Many start up companies paying their servers from investors or they own money. But eventually they will need to make money to be able to pay the servers and employees. It's either by introducing a monthly subscription fee or putting ads in the application. And even with this, most of them will shut down after a while. Making you lose all your data.
On the other hand the CalCalSheet is yours, it's running on your google sheet drive. It costs nothing to me or you to run it. And I can confidently say it will be available till Google exists.

## Are they ads in the app?
No, the sheet is completely ad free.
